Brian Anderson, Com S 311, Readme for Project 7.

Disclaimer
===========
I didn't have enough time to budget for a great solution to this problem.
I tried my best give the 4 full hours I had to do this project.


On enumerateAnagramsUnderE()
==============================
I am happy with my enumerateAnagramsUnderE() implementation. There isn't much pruning
happening at this level, though I have only elected to do the dictionary check
if the string length is the same for what I am looking for


On enumerateAnagramsUnderBagE
===============================
I didn't have enough time to optimize this. I basically find all of the anagram sets
that are less than or equal to the total length. But I didn't find a way to optimize
this to find the correct size only, so I need to loop through it again and weed
out the ones that are too small.

Oops.
