 * You are to implement the following interface for compressing data using the LZ algorithm using a trie as described above, and a second time using the Java HashMap data structure.
 *
 * However, the LZ dictionary must be stored in a trie data structure of your own creation.
 * Turn in the file LZtrie.java and any other source files you create.
 * Place all such files in the default package.
